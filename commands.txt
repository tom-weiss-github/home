lsb_release -i -r
Print vendor and version information of linux distribution.

find / -type f -size +1000k | xargs -n 1 ls -l --block-size=M
Find all files over 1000 kbs and then print the size of each of those
files in mbs.

find . -mtime +10 | xargs -n 1 --no-run-if-empty rm -v
Remove files older than 10 days.  The -n 1 ensure that if there are large numbers of files the
rm command won't be too long, instead a new command will be created for each file.

df -h
Print disk usage.

du -hs <directory>
Print disk usage of some directory, recursive.

lsof
Print open files (which may not be shown in find or ls if the file
has been deleted, but a file descriptor is still open).

dd of=/path/to/file if=/dev/null bs=1GB count=10
Create a 10GB file with all zeros.

ls | xargs -n 1 -i echo \{\}, | xargs -n 4
This command is to illustrate some features of xargs.  The \{\} combined
with -i allow the output from the piped command to be inserted in the
middle of the command xargs is building.  The -n allows some number of
inputs to be combined together.  This will print four items separated
by commas on each line.

abrt-cli list -f | grep Directory | cut -d" " -f 7 | xargs -i -n 1 sh -c 'echo directory {} has UUID; cat {}/uuid; echo '
This command will print all the abrt directories and and a file in the directory.
It uses sh -c to use the directory for 2 commands.

knife search "recipe:zookeeper AND environment:dev" -a ipaddress | grep ipaddress | tail -1 | tr -s " " | cut -d":" -f 2
Similar to other cut examples, but this one uses the tr command to trim extra whitespace to assist cut.

ttknife search node "chef_environment:int-dev-cert" -a ipaddress |  grep ipaddress  | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f 3 | xargs -n 1 -i ping -c 5 -q \{\} | grep -iE "statistics|packet"
Search for nodes in int-dev-cert that are not running.

echo -n `date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`; git log --abbrev-commit --graph --date-order --date=relative --pretty=oneline | head -1 | sed -e 's/^*[ \t]*/_/g' | sed 's/\ /_/g' | sed 's/[^a-zA-Z0-9_]//g'
Simple sed usage example.  Format the latest git log in a particular format.

Needs more investigation: After merging a branch into develop, the push to origin/develop fails
because someone else beat me to it.  John suggests the following commands to avoid the bad merge
that results from a 'git pull':
git fetch
git rebase -p origin/develop
John also suggests that rerere needs to be enabled to remember the conflict resolution in the
case that the merge had many conflicts that would be painful to resolve again after the rebase.

grep af1518ac-c801-438e-b70d-4fc59e67a079 `lsoc bb1` | sed 's/.*order_sequence: //g' | sed 's/correlation_cl_ord_id.*//g' | sort | uniq --repeated
grep -c af1518ac-c801-438e-b70d-4fc59e67a079 `lsoc bb1` | sed 's/.*order_sequence: //g' | sed 's/correlation_cl_ord_id.*//g'
Command to parse log file for GUID and filter out most of the message.  the first sed removes everything before 'order_sequence: ' and
the second sed removes everything after.  The resuls are then sorted and passed to uniq to check for repeated fields.  To verify no skipped
values, the second command gives the total number.

for i in {1..10}; do command; done
Run a command in a loop on the command line.

watch -n 5 ls -l
Repeat a command over and over every 5 seconds.

watch -n 1 ntpstat
Run a command over and over (once per second).  In this case the command will
indicate if ntp is synchronized.

files=`aws s3 ls s3://deploy-debesys | grep debesys_ | tr -s " " | cut -d" " -f 4`
for old in $files; do
    echo old $old
    new=${old//debesys_/debesys-}
    echo new $new
    aws s3 mv s3://deploy-debesys/$old s3://deploy-debesys/$new
done
Rename all files in S3 with a new name based on a regular expression.

git
---
git log --graph --date-order --abbrev-commit --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s" > ~/glog.txt
Print git log to a file.

git clean -fn
Remove all untracked files (-n for dry run).

                 (bad)                                    (good)
git bisect start 5666bedf39bff85dd208be0e905681cafd303fd5 f8928e3
chmod +x ~/githome/git_bisect_make.sh
git bisect run ~/githome/git_bisect_make.sh
(commit should be the one which transitioned from good to bad)
git bisect reset (when done)

git reset --hard HASH
Make HEAD move to HASH.

To create a local origin:
git clone git@github.com:tradingtechnologies/debesys.git --mirror fake_remote
You can't do much with this repo except clone from it.

git clone file:///home/tweiss/dev-root/fake_remote/ 1_local_remote
(then git submodule init/update; note that the submodules still point back
 to original origin)

git clone file:///home/tweiss/dev-root/fake_remote/ 2_local_remote
Why two clones?  That way you can push from one, then pull from the other
to verify your changes are getting pushed as expected.

tcpdump
-------
tcpdump -D
Lists all the interfaces, the number is used for -i on future commands.

tcpdump -i 1 dst 10.140.18.67 and port 16058
Show all messages from destination and port.

tcpdump -i 1 host 10.140.18.67 and port 16058

Xming
-----
Steps to set up X11 forwarding from RHEL to Windows.
- Install Xming from sourceforge.net/project/xming (default installation).
- Install Xmingfonts sourceforge.net/projects/xming/files (required for emacs).
- Install putty.
- Install puttygen.
- In putty configure the following settings:
  - Session -> Saved Sessions Give the session a name
    and save/load it to make sure the rest are not lost.
  - Connection -> Data -> Auto-login username 'debesys'
    (or whatever username you want to log in with)
  - Connection -> Seconds between keep alive 120
  - If no existing public/private key pairs exist, create a new
    pair on the linux machine with the command:
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "Tom.Weiss@TradingTechnologies.com -f ~/.ssh/windows_to_linux
  - Copy private key from linux machine into c:\Users\USER\.ssh\tmp_key
    Put the public key in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on linux host.
    Launch puttygen.
    Select Conversions Menu.
    Open the c:\Users\USER\.ssh\tmp_key file.
    Select the 'Save private key' button and name with extension .ppk.
    SSH -> Auth -> Private key file for authentication -> Browse to the
    ppk file just created.
   - X11 -> Enable X11 Forwarding.
  - Session -> Host <IP of host>
  - Potential X11 Performance Improvements outlined here:
    http://xmodulo.com/2013/07/how-to-speed-up-x11-forwarding-in-ssh.html
    Under Connection -> SSH -> Check Enable Compression
    Under Encryption Options -> Choose Arcfour then Blowfish.
  - Save.

gnome
-----
I believe that for some of these changes, the user needs to log out for them to take effect.
To stop cursor from blinking launch gnome-keyboard-properties and uncheck cursor blinking textbox,
use --get to view the current settings.  This command works on versions >= 2.31.3:
gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/interface/cursor_blink --type boolean False
gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/cursor_blink --type boolean False
gconftool-2 --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/cursor_blink_mode --type string off
General -> Font: Monospace 14
Check 'Use custom default terminal size' 200 columns 25 rows
Colors -> Text Color: #10F015
Colors -> Background Color: #000000
Scrolling -> check Unlimited
To prevent function keys from being caught in emacs -nw mode, open the Keyboard Shortcuts
and uncheck "Enable the menu shortcut key (F10 by default).  Then go through all the
shortcuts and use backspace in combination with clicking to disable the shortcuts mapped
to function keys.
gnome-about --gnome-version to get the version of gnome.

yum
---
sudo yum provides /bin/ls
Indicates which package provides a file.

yum list installed
Shows which packages are installed.

sudo yum repolist
Shows which repos are used for installed packages.

yum search package
Shows more details about packages.

rpm -q --queryformat "%{EPOCH} : %{NAME} - %{VERSION} - %{RELEASE} . %{ARCH}\n" gdb
Query local machine for information about which gdb is installed.

repoquery -q --queryformat "%{EPOCH} : %{NAME} - %{VERSION} - %{RELEASE} . %{ARCH}\n" gdb
Query repos in /etc/yum.repos.d/ for packages.

networking
----------
Disable ip messaging from local machine to some ip address (e.g., 10.203.0.43).
sudo service iptables start
sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d "10.203.0.43" -j DROP
sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -d "10.203.0.43" -j DROP
sudo service iptables stop

(stop networking for a while)
sudo service iptables start; sudo iptables -A OUTPUT -d "10.203.0.43" -j DROP; sleep 60; sudo iptables -D OUTPUT -d "10.203.0.43" -j DROP; sudo service iptables stop

Physical ports can be in one of two modes:
1) access (a.k.a., untagged, single vlan)
2) trunk (a.k.a., vlan tagging, dot1q, 802.1q, multiple vlan, multiple layer 3 interfaces)

ifconfig
Prints network information.
ethN is a physical port.  If there is a IPV4 address then the port is in access
mode.  Otherwise the port is in trunk mode.  If you examine the MAC of a vlan
it will correspond to the MAC of one of the physical ports, which is the port
being used by the vlan.

/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-X
Each file describes a layer 3 interface available to the operating system.

ethtool ethN
Another way to get information about an interface.

lldptool -tnl ethN
(yum install TT-LLDP-SETUP --nogpgcheck)
Package created to provide extra information about switch connections.

/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules
Contains configuration which maps ethN names to MAC addresses.

ifup/ifdown
Bring an inteface up or down.  Check in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-X
for a list of all the interfaces.
