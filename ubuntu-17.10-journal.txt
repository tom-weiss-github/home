Monitor Settings


Figure out why I can't log into gnome anymore.  After I cloned githome and created some files the
logout froze.  Perhaps try reinstalling gnome.



RESOLVED
========
Can't resolve rest.int.tt.local.  This can be resolved by opening /etc/nsswitch.conf and change the line
marked hosts to be:
hosts: files mdns4_minimal dns [NOTFOUND=return] mdns4
This will move 'dns' to be before NOTFOUND.

Pidgin persistent notifications.  Installed the chrome gnome shell extention (after installing I
also had to run the command 'sudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell'.  This let me install a nice
pidgin plugin called Pidgin Persistent Notification at
https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/170/pidgin-peristent-notification/.  This puts a nice icon on
the top tray that turns red and stays red when I get a message (until I read it).  I also installed
'Frippery Move Clock' to move the clock over to the right.

Bluetooth headphones.

Resolved by opening the sound settings, and in the Profile, switching to
'High Fidelity Playback (A2DP Sink)'.

This seems to be me accidentally setting the function keys on the laptop.  I used the esc-fn hotkey
to switch them back and the issue was resolved.


Get the thirds.sh and nothirds.sh working again via the shortcut menu.

Figure out how to limit the pidgin notifications.
Most of the detailed notifications can be found in the various plugins.  They need to be configured to limit the notifications.
